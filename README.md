1. How is the schema in MongoDB different from relational tables?
  MongoDB is more flexible — it lets you store data without strict rules. In relational databases, everything must follow a fixed format, like filling out the same form every time.

2. What are the pros/cons of flexible schemas?
   Pros: Easier to change and update as your app grows. Great for messy or changing data.

  Cons: Can get disorganized if not careful, and it's harder to check for errors in the data.

3. When would you choose NoSQL over traditional SQL databases?
   Pick NoSQL if your data changes a lot or doesn't fit a strict format. Use SQL if you need organized, consistent data with clear rules — like in banking or school records.
